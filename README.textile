h1. Beastie

A bare-bones command-line bug tracking system for personal or small projects which require little formality.

h2. Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

<pre>
  gem 'beastie'
</pre>

And then execute:

<pre>
  $ bundle
</pre>

Or install it yourself as:

<pre>
  $ gem install beastie
</pre>

h2. Usage

Beastie is a bug tracking system at its bare essentials.

Main commands:

- @beastie new@ := asks information about an issue and generate a YAML file in the current directory.

- @beastie nedit@ := enter a new issue using the default editor (@nedit@ = new and edit; see @edit@ for the specificaiton of the editor)

- @beastie list@ := reads all YAML files in the current directory and generate a list of all the issues.

- @beastie show N@ := shows issue @N@, where @N@ is the identifier shown by the @beastie list@ command.

- @beastie edit N@ := edits issue @N@.  The commands invokes the editor set in the shell @EDITOR@ variable or use @emacsclient@ if @EDITOR@ is unset.

- @beastie help@ := unleashes the real power of @beastie@.

h2. Managing Different Projects

By default @beastie@ uses the *current directory* when executing a command. While this makes gives a lot of freedom in choosing one's standards, it also require a lot of discipline (you always need to make sure you are in the right directory) and can be inconvenient at times.  

For this reason, from version 0.3, @beastie@ supports the following two options to specify the directory to use when executing a command:

* option @-d@ (@--directory@) to specify the destination directory
* option @-p@ (@--project@) to use a specific project for a directory

*Option @-d@.* Use @-d <dir>@ (or @--directory <dir>@) to specify the directory in which the command is executed.

For instance:

<pre>
  beastie -d ~/issues show
</pre>

will show all issues stored in the @~/issue@ directory.

*Option @-p@.* Use @-p <name>@ (or @--project <name>@) to specify the name of a project and @beastie@ will perform the operation on the directory associated to @<name>@ in the @~/.beastie_projects@ file.

Entries in the @.beastie_projects@ file look like:

<pre>
<name>:
  dir: <dir>
<another name>:
  dir: <another dir>
</pre>

For instance, if @.beastie_projects@ contains:

<pre>
  beastie:
    dir: /Users/guest/beastie_issues
</pre>

then

<pre>
  $ beastie -p beastie show
</pre>

will show all the issues stored in the @/Users/guest/beastie_issues@ directory.

Use only one of @-d@ or @-p@; if you do not, @-d@ has precedence.

h2. Remarks and Warnings

Beastie generates human-readable filenames, following the convention "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com has for blog posts.  Selecting issues using filenames, however, is a bit clumsy and to simplify operations @beastie@ assigns a number to each issue, which can be used to reference them.  The number can be seen with the @list@ command and depends upon the order in which issues are listed in the directory.  Thus *the same issue might be assigned a different id over time*, if the order in which files are read changes (e.g., if a new back-dated issue is added by hand).

Beastie does not have a specific workflow for bug statutes.

Beastie does not perform syntax checks when reading data.  This can be changed by specifying appropriate input functions in the @ISSUE_FIELDS@ variable (@lib/beastie/issue.rb@).

Beastie asks various information about a bug.  Change the @ISSUE_FIELDS@ variable, if you are not happy with the default fieldset.

Beastie does not have fancy sorting and filtering functions.  The unix commands @sort@ and @grep@ can be reasonable work-arounds.  For instance the list of open bugs can be gotten with:

<pre>
  beastie list | grep open
</pre>

To sort issues by priority:

<pre>
  beastie list | grep -v "^ID" | sort -n -k 4
</pre>

Exceptions apply.


h2. Similar solutions

There are different command-line bug tracking systems.  The ones I came across with before re-inventing the wheel include: ditz, "bugs everywhere":http://bugseverywhere.org, "ticgit-Ng":https://github.com/jeffWelling/ticgit, "bugzyrb":https://github.com/rkumar/bugzyrb, "git-issues":https://github.com/duplys/git-issues, "later":https://github.com/qznc/later.

So... why did I re-invent the wheel? 

# for fun
# human-readable filenames, so that I can manage issues without using beastie, if I want
# a "programmable" fieldset (see @lib/beastie/issue.rb@)
# keeping the solution simple (280 lines of ruby code, according to @sloccount@)

Use @beastie@! According to @sloccount@, you using a software which costed $8,033! (... as you might guess, COCOMO does not work well for small systems.)
